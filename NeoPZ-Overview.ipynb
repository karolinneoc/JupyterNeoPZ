    "The NeoPZ library even contains classes to implement vectors! The reason for doing so is that most programming errors are due to accessing elements of vectors out of bounds. As the stl::vector class does not perform element access verifications we needed to write our own. Another motive is that the std::vector class does not have a robust interface for allocating vectors with pre-allocated storage. There exists a std::vector variant that preallocates storage on the stack, but it does not allow to extend the dimension of the object beyond the preallocated storage.\n",
